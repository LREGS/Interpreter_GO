# Writing an Interpreter in GO 

## Chapter One

*Defining the lexer*
    Position and readposition in lexer are used to access the characted in input
    by using them as an index. 

    These 'pointers' allow us to look further into the input and see what is 
    coming next so we can look after the current value which is ch.

    readposition always points to whats next, and position always points to
    the character in the into that corresponds with the ch byte, the current 
    character.
